# Statistical-Analysis-of-Medical-Data Midterm project 
In this code, several statistical tests have been conducted on numerical data obtained from MRI images of the subjects. Based on these tests, we will infer the statistical distribution of the data among different subject group and we will visualize them. these data have been collected from OASIS-2 dataset. This set consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. the scans for each subject were acquired during their yearly visits. However, we only focused on the last scans of them. 72 of the subjects were characterized as nondemented throughout the study. 64 of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans. Another 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit (converted to demented).
in this project the goal was to find the relationship between eTIV (estimated Total Intracarnial Volume of brain) and demntia level (demented, nondemented and converted).
